# Changelog

All notable changes to VoxTether will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-27

### 🚀 Major Changes

#### Complete Client-Server Architecture
The application is now fully split into separate client and server components:

- **Client (Electron)**: Desktop application for Windows with UI and system tray
- **Server (Python FastAPI)**: Backend transcription service that runs on localhost or a network server

**Benefits:**
- **Flexible Deployment**: Run the server on a powerful machine with GPU, clients on any Windows PC
- **No Bundled Executables**: Backend runs as pure Python - no PyInstaller needed
- **Easier Updates**: Update client and server independently
- **Network Support**: Multiple clients can share one backend server

#### Frontend Rewrite: Electron.js
The entire frontend has been rewritten from WinUI 3 (.NET) to Electron.js for a more modern, maintainable, and potentially cross-platform experience.

**Why Electron?**
- **Modern Web Technologies**: Uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the UI
- **Easier to Maintain**: Single codebase, faster development cycle
- **Better Tooling**: npm ecosystem, hot reload during development
- **Future-Ready**: Potential for cross-platform support (macOS, Linux)

### ✨ New Features
